        <p>
            Sol + Luna, is one of those projects that as a designer I enjoy from beginning to end. After meeting with these young siblings I couldnâ€™t help but be moved by their empathy and devotion in helping other kids have a bright future. Their spirit, inspired me and made this project extremely gratifying.

        <p>
            Throughout my final semester at California State University of Long Beach, I had the opportunity to develop, research, conceptualize and design a project I am deeply passionate about. Nour is a dream that I was able to put on paper and hope to one day bring to life.

        <p>
            Elf Cosmetics reached out looking for a multi-purpose design that was both functional and on brand. This proved to be a challenge due to spacial implications. However, there is nothing I enjoy more than problem solving. At the end every need was met.
